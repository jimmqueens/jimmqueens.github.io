     <h2>Name</h2>
   <p><strong>Jim Murphy</strong></p>
   <h2>Biography</h2>
   <p>I've been teaching TESOL for some time to adult learners 
    and have been doing so virtually for the past several years.
     I enjoy exercising and staying active with a little travel
      thrown in.</p>
      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>Keeping current with the ever-changing 
        tech world is interesting.</p>
        <h3>Goal in taking this course</h3>
        <p>I think I’d like to add some web assets to my students’ learning experiences; 
            this course should add to those assets.</p>
            <h4>Other interests</h4>
            <p>Like many of you, I've started using AI for different tasks 
                and am not <em>sure</em> but <em>curious</em> about where it’s going to lead us.</p>
