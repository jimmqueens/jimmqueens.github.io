    <h1>HEALTHIER TRADITIONS COOKBOOK<sub>1</sub></h1>
       <p>Homemade dishes like this stir fry help to avoid unhealthy preservatives commonly
          used in restaurants and store-bought sauces.<br />
          This stir fry is reminiscent of a dish from a Chinese takeout restaurant but uses
          wholesome and nutritious ingredients,<br />
          such as heart-healthy olive oil and fresh ginger and garlic. Feel free to substitute any
          precooked vegetables—such as zucchini,<br />
          broccoli, and/or carrots—that you may have on hand for the frozen vegetables.<br />

                <dd>The simple ingredient lists for these recipes help to shorten your
                     trips to the grocery store and take up less space in your refrigerator<br />
                     and freezer. These recipes also require minimal equipment, making them 
                     accessible for people with all types of kitchens and at all stages of life.<br />
                     All can be made on a stovetop, in a microwave, or right on your countertop—
                     no oven required. So with these recipes, there is no need to wait for anything<br />
                     to preheat or to heat up your kitchen on hot summer days. And using fewer
                     dishes also reduces the amount of cleanup and dishwashing afterward.</dd>

                <dd>Many of these recipes are plant-forward, encouraging you to add more vegetables, 
                    legumes, and whole grains into your diet. The recipes are all balanced<br />
                    and suitable for omnivores, though. We offer suggestions about modifications 
                    that can be made to make a vegetarian (or even vegan) version of several recipes.</dd>
