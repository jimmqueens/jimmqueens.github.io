  <h4>The beginning...</h4>
    <p style="font-size: 14px;"> 
        
        Once upon a time (I know, <em>trite</em>), some students hoped to add web design to their portfolios. 
        At their favorite university, <b>Quinnipiac</b>, they realized that their summer could be 
        well spent by taking an extremely enlighteng course:
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Web Design for Instruction IDN 530.</strong>
    </p> 
    
  <h4>the why...</h4> 
  <p>As Jon Duckett says in <i>HTML&CSS design and build websites</i>, <q>Understanding <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and 
    <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> can help anyone who works with the web…</q></p>
 
    <h4>the how...</h4> 
  <p>When creating and designing  projects, web design requires familiarity with <abbr title="User Experience">UX</abbr> 
    and <abbr title="User Interface">UI</abbr>.</p>
  <blockquote cite=“https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/uxui-design-101-non-designers-shubham-verma”>

    <p style="font-size: 16px;">A fundamental principle in the design world is: Form follows function.
  What that means is that an effectively designed thing is:<hr>
  1.	Functional first - it has to be able to perform the said task.<br />
  2.	Effective in helping users carry out the task - with as least friction as possible.<br />
  3.	And the form (visual design) of that thing supports the function it is supposed to perform.<hr>
  In other words - make it usable and then make it pretty. There is another school of thought in design where function 
  follows form but let's keep it simple for now.
  Let's talk about UX/UI now. UX and UI Design are two of the many sub-divisions under Digital Design.<br /><br />
  UI Design: focused on the form - e.g. color, font, arrangement of elements on the screen, etc.<br /><br />
  UX Design: focused on the function - e.g. how does a group of screens form a workflow which allows user 
  to do a particular action.<sub>1</sub>

  <h4>Fortunately...</h4>
  <p style="font-size: 16px";> "You don’t need to know everything about UX" and 
    "You don’t need to learn all of it from the start."<sub>3</sub><br />
    Of course,<del> I already know it all</del>
    <ins>I can only hope to gain enough knowledge to creating something useful.</ins><br />
